# Introduction

Sphinx Homepage Data Extractor is a Python script which extracts  
relevant syntax data such as names for directives and roles and  
then converts this data to a number of output formats such as   
CSV, HTML (in a report similar to Ned Batchelder's coverage.py),  
TextMate prefs and finally text files with Ruby/Python lists.

It was made primarily for my [SphinxDoc.tmbundle](http://github.com/andreberg/SphinxDoc.tmbundle.git) to update the  
auto-completion lists.

# Usage

`cd` into this source directory in a terminal and just run `main.py`,  
for example:

`python main.py -h` 

or 

`python main.py --outdir OUTDIR --force --formats all --verbose`
