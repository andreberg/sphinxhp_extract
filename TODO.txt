Sphinx Homepage Data Extractor


TODO

Project

- Rename sphinxhp to sphinxhp-data-extractor
  
  Take care to rename sys.path.insert's in the tests and
  look for other places where the name is used in textual context.


data.py

- Provide working caching mechanism for Databases
  
  Use a module level dict instead, make sure __eq__ and __hash__ compare on 
  site_url (think they already do) and check for existing db in __init__ or initialize. 
  
- Remove side effect of self.initialize() in some methods. 

  Make call to initialize explicit and a responsibility of the user of the database.
  Do this by instead checking for self.initialized == True and raising some error if 
  an initialized state is needed.

- Fix data_tests.py

  I think some of the tests still work under the assumption that the db initializes 
  itself on __init__.
